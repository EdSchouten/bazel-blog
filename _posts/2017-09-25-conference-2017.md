title: Bazel Conference 2017
---

**We are inspired** by our community's engagement in the upcoming [Bazel Conference](https://sites.google.com/corp/bazel.build/conference2017). We've received a large number of requests for talks and topics for discussion, and have scheduled tech talks by engineers at large and small companies on working with Bazel in wide variety of languages, including Scala, JavaScript and Go. We are looking forward to haveing 200 engineers from 35 companies and 4 countries share their experience with Bazel.

**We are humbled** by the committment to making Bazel even better, and seeing engineers develop advanced features, such as Remote Execution [bazel.buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm), and sharing migration tips, tricks and tools. You will hear user stories and tips about iOS migration, and moving TensorFlow and Kubernetes to Bazel. We will also discuss as a community what are the different tools out there that could be open sourced. 

**We are excited** to see all of you at this first annual [Bazel Conference](https://sites.google.com/corp/bazel.build/conference2017) in Sunnyvale, California on November 6 and 7, 2017!
