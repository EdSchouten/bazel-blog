title: Thank you for BazelCon 2017
---

We are truly thankful to our community for making our first annual [**Bazel Conference**](https://sites.google.com/corp/bazel.build/conference2017) a success! Talk videos are now published on YouTube and you can access them here [link]

Your feedback reflected high level of satisfaction as we had topics of interest for everyone:
* Bazel usage ang migration stories from TensorFlow, Kubernetes, SpaceX, Pinterest, Wix, Stripe, DataBricks, and Dropbox
* Talks about upcoming features and tools such as [remote execution & caching](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm), [buildozer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/tree/master/buildozer), [cs.bazel.build](https://cs.bazel.build/), scala support, robolectric tests, [PodToBUILD](https://github.com/pinterest/PodToBUILD), [bazeltfc](https://github.com/Asana/bazeltsc), [rules_typescript](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript) presented by Uber, Two Sigma, Google, Stripe, Pinterest, and Asana.
* Office hours where you got your Bazel questions answered, met engineers, debugged on the fly, and some even got remote execution with [buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm) working while there!

BazelCon by the Numbers:
* 200+ attendees
* 60 organizations
* 30 speakers
* 20 informative talks
* 14 hours of hands-on debugging and Q&A during Office Hours

What we heard from you:
* Bazel Query is great!
* Python is used broader than we thoght and Bazel support is needed.
* Reproducible builds are important especially when you're flying rockets, building autonomous vehicles, delivering media, and calculating financial transactions, leading to wider Bazel adoption by these communities.
* Documentation is often hard to find or is too basic or too advanced
* Bazel's Parallelism is impressive: much faster than Maven
* IDE integration is important, particularly with Visual Studio and CLion
* Build Event Protocol enables many options for internal visualization of events
* Aspects are a powerful tool

What we could do next:
* Work on better documentation and training, particularly for intermetiate-level
* Prioritize IDE intregration
* Engage community in building better Python support in Bazel
* Implement third party dependencies/WORKSPACE project
* Continue work on cross platform improvements
* Engage community in wider adoption and contribution to Bazel

What you could do next:
* Contribute to Bazel, particularly to the new community driven [buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm) effort
* Kick off local meet-ups (we will reach out to volunteers who responded to this in our survey)
* Get more info on Bazel at Bazel.build
* Join the discussion on bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com
* Stay tuned for Bazel Conference 2018!

We look forward to working with you and growing our Bazel user community in 2018!
