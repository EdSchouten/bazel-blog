---

We are truly thankful to our community for making our first annual [**Bazel Conference**](https://sites.google.com/corp/bazel.build/conference2017) a success! Talk videos are now published on YouTube and you can access them here [link]

Your feedback reflected high level of satisfaction as we had topics of interest for everyone:
**  Migration stories and hacks from SpaceX, Pinterest, TensorFlow, Kubernetes, ...TODO

** Talks about upcoming features and tools by Uber, Two Sigma, Google, ...TODO

** Office hours where you got your Bazel questions answered, met engineers, debugged on the fly, and some even got remote execution with [buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm) working while there!

BazelCon by the Numbers:
** 200+ attendees

** 60 organizations

** 30 speakers

** 20 informative talks

** 14 hours of hands-on debugging and Q&A during Office Hours
